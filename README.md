# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This project was created by following tutorial made by JavascriptMastery YT channel, and is based on Figma design by AR Shakir. Purpose of this project is to get familiarized with Figma and the tranformation of it's design into code. The code also follows BEM naming convention for css classes. Writing css like this in this project, I realized I didn't really like it that much, which is why I've used modules/tailwind in most of my other projects, my favorite types of css writing from React/Next projects.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
